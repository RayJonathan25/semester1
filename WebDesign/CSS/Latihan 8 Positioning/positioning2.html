			<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
				
				<div class="position-1">
					<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels, 
						the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, 
						thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.

					To keep your balance you must keep moving"-Albert Einstein

					The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. 
							This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any 
							other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.
